# React + Vite

Component-Based Architecture:

-  React is known for its component-based architecture, where the UI is divided into reusable components. This feature allows you to create modular, maintainable, and scalable code.

State Management:
- React provides state management through component state and context API. You can use local component state for managing UI-related data and libraries like Redux or Mobx for global state management in larger applications.
Routing:
-  React Router is a popular library for adding client-side routing to your application. It enables the creation of multi-page applications while maintaining a single-page application feel.
